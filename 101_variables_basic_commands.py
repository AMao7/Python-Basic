# Variables in Python
    # A variable is a box. And we put stuff inside and give it a name

# Assign a variable
box_pillows = 'Pillows and stuff' # gave the box a name and put stuff inside

print(box_pillows) # Look inside a box

box_pillows = 'Books' # changing the stuff inside the box
print(box_pillows)

box_pillows = 14 # reassigning to different data types
print(box_pillows)

# Important functions in python
# print()
# type()  returns the data type of the variable inside
# input() prompts user for input

print('Hello there!, What is your name?')
what_is_your_name = input()
print('Hi There, ', (what_is_your_name))
